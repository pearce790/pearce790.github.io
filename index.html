              <b>About Me</b><br>
              Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics at <a href="https://www.reed.edu/">Reed College</a> in the <a href="https://www.reed.edu/math">Department of Mathematics and Statistics</a>. I completed my Ph.D. in statistics in 2023 at the <a href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>, advised by Professor <a href="https://sites.stat.washington.edu/elena/">Elena A. Erosheva</a>.<br><br>
              
              I am a Bayesian statistician with work in ordinal data methods, model-based clustering, and statistical demography. Recently, I have focused on the statistical analysis of preference data, such as ratings and rankings. The goal of these methods is to infer a population's preferences, opinions, or attitudes, often with the goal of improving collective decision-making. This work has applications in voting theory, peer review, and survey data analysis.<br><br>
              
              I earned a B.A. in mathematics with a concentration in statistics from <a href="https://www.stolaf.edu/">St. Olaf College</a>. Outside of academia, I have worked as a data analytics consultant at Deloitte LLP and an applied statistics intern at Boeing. I am originally from Long Lake, Minnesota. In my free time, I enjoy biking, trail running, climbing, watching movies, and singing with the Portland Gay Men's Chorus.<br><br>
